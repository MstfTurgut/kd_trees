# Kd-Trees

This project implements a data type to represent a set of points in the unit square (all points have x- and y-coordinates between 0 and 1) using a 2d-tree to support efficient range search (find all of the points contained in a query rectangle) and nearest-neighbor search (find a closest point to a query point).

## Geometric Primitives

To get started, we use the following geometric primitives for points and axis-aligned rectangles in the plane.

## Implementation

### Brute-Force

In the brute-force algorithm (PointSET) we use red-black binary search tree API.

### 2d-Tree

A 2d-tree is a generalization of a BST to two-dimensional keys. The idea is to build a BST with points in the nodes, using the x- and y-coordinates of the points as keys in strictly alternating sequence.

* Search and insert. The algorithms for search and insert are similar to those for BSTs, but at the root we use the x-coordinate (if the point to be inserted has a smaller x-coordinate than the point at the root, go left; otherwise go right); then at the next level, we use the y-coordinate (if the point to be inserted has a smaller y-coordinate than the point in the node, go left; otherwise go right); then at the next level the x-coordinate, and so forth.

* Draw. A 2d-tree divides the unit square in a simple way: all the points to the left of the root go in the left subtree; all those to the right go in the right subtree; and so forth, recursively. 

The prime advantage of a 2d-tree over a BST is that it supports efficient implementation of range search and nearest-neighbor search. Each node corresponds to an axis-aligned rectangle in the unit square, which encloses all of the points in its subtree. The root corresponds to the unit square; the left and right children of the root corresponds to the two rectangles split by the x-coordinate of the point at the root; and so forth.

* Range search. To find all points contained in a given query rectangle, start at the root and recursively search for points in both subtrees using the following pruning rule: if the query rectangle does not intersect the rectangle corresponding to a node, there is no need to explore that node (or its subtrees). A subtree is searched only if it might contain a point contained in the query rectangle.
 
* Nearest-neighbor search. To find a closest point to a given query point, start at the root and recursively search in both subtrees using the following pruning rule: if the closest point discovered so far is closer than the distance between the query point and the rectangle corresponding to a node, there is no need to explore that node (or its subtrees). That is, search a node only only if it might contain a point that is closer than the best one found so far. The effectiveness of the pruning rule depends on quickly finding a nearby point. To do this, organize the recursive method so that when there are two possible subtrees to go down, we always choose the subtree that is on the same side of the splitting line as the query point as the first subtree to exploreâ€”the closest point found while exploring the first subtree may enable pruning of the second subtree.
